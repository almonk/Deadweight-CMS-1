Deadweight private beta 0.1
---------------------------

Installation instructions;

1. Upload all the files to wherever you want
2. Rename htaccess to .htaccess
3. Go to app/application/config/config.php and change the base_url to whatever you're using
4. Go to the root of your Deadweight site, everything should be working normally

When you're ready to deploy your website make sure you go to app/application/config/parser.php and give a cache time for your templates otherwise there's gonna be some heavylifting going on on your server.


Known issues:

- htaccess is a fickle beast so you might have to lookup how your host likes to have the file formatted

- If you get a 404 error after installing try changing the value '$config['uri_protocol']= "AUTO";' in config.php

- If you have loads of problems with htaccess you can disable the clean urls by deleting the htaccess file altogether and adding in the relevant field in the config.php

- Complete relative path needs to be used to include templates within templates at the moment
